# EC530-Exercise1
matching geo locations
I took out the facts about me (wasn't sure if that was necessary)

NOTE: I started out in C++ but then switched to python because it is mentioned a lot in the lecture slides and my partners were using python. I have never really coded in python before so I think it's good I'm learning it now.

I am currently working on improving my code in these ways:
1. Do logging in python
2. looking at the memory (trace malloc)
3. looking at the CPU times
4. Improving efficiency by some algorithm rather than testing every location in array 1 against every location in array 2
5. Creating good test files and checking how the coverage changes
