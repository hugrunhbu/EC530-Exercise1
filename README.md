Hi I'm supposed to write a little bit about myself here so here are 5 facts about me:
1. My name is Hugrún Helgadóttir
   a. no one in america can pronounce my name correctly
2. I'm from Iceland and only moved here for college
3. I don't know what I want to do with my life when I graduate
4. I play soccer here and now it's over since we are a fall sport and I'm a senior
5. I miss it but I also love to have some free time now

NOTE: when running the C++ code I needed to write g++ -std=c++17 -o main mainfile.cpp not just g++ -o main mainfile.cpp

NOTE: unsurprisingly did I find out that London was the closest european city to all the american cities except for Miami that is the closest to Madrid
